Programming assignments for coursework in computational vision and deep learning.

p1:
- `programming1_filter.py` focuses on the implementation and application of different filters to two different images, filter1_img.jp and filter2_img.jpg. The filters used are gaussian, difference of gaussian in x dimension, difference of gaussian in y dimension, and sobel fitler.
- `programming1_kmeans.py` focuses on using k-means clustering to segment image pixels into groups of varibale sizes.
- `programming1_sift.py` focuses on applying the sift (scale invariant feature-transform) to identify and match features between images of the same object. 

p2:
- `programming2.py` focuses on identifying movement vectors for two frames in a video. It accomplishes this by applying the Sobel filter to each frame and taking the difference between each pixel. 

p3: 
- `programming3.py` focuses on applying transfer learning to a pre-trained convolutional neural network and using it to distinguishing between images of cats and dogs.

p4:
- `programming5base.py` focuses on implementing an autoenconder model that compresses images from the fashion MNIST dataset into two values and then attempts to decompress the two values back into the original image. 

p5:
- `programming5base.py` focuses on designing an generator-discriminator model which generate images of clothing items are then discerns whether or not the images are believably drawn from the fashion MNIST dataset.
- `programming5cgan.py` focuses on designing an convolutional neural network-based generator-discriminator model which generate images of clothing items are then discerns whether or not the images are believably drawn from the fashion MNIST dataset.
